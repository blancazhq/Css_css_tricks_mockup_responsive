        <p class="quote">I don't believe that the overall page length itself is inherently problematic. I have noticed though that in many responsive designs, purposeful groupings of content are easy to spot on larger screens, but get muddled when things start to stack on mobile screens.</p>

        <p class="content_text">This is probably mostly a problem on "content" sites in which you smash things down into the ol' tube of content. I don't mind the tube, but I think Kevin is doing some smart thinking here. There are plenty of different patterns that can happen while tubizing, and it's probably not thought about enough.</p>
        <p class="content_text">When designing responsive sites, we tend to focus a lot on keeping content nicely formatted within all the various screen widths in the world today. This makes sense given that horizontal scrolling is not particularly user-friendly, so constraining the design to the browser's viewport width is generally a given.</p>
        <p class="content_text">On smaller screens, stacking things into a single column is the go-to move and often, as long as the content stays within the proper width, further thought isn't given to the height of the page. As a result, I've noticed that in my own designs and many out in the wild, mobile page lengths tend to be quite long. This post is a suggestion to at least keep the height of the browser's viewport in mind as you're designing responsive sites.</p>
